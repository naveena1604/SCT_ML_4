# Task_4_Hand_Gesture_Recognition

# ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a **Hand Gesture Recognition** model capable of detecting and classifying different hand gestures from images or videos. It enables **gesture-based control systems** and facilitates **intuitive human-computer interaction** (HCI).

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a computer vision model that:

- Detects and classifies hand gestures from image or video data
- Supports real-time or batch processing
- Enables applications like touchless interfaces, robotics control, and sign language recognition

---

## 🗃️ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:

- Thousands of labeled images of different hand gestures
- Grayscale/RGB images, generally resized to 28x28 or 64x64 pixels
- Multiple gesture classes (e.g., “thumbs up”, “fist”, “stop”, “okay”)

---

## 🧠 Model Summary

- Preprocessing with OpenCV or PIL
- Classification models explored:
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** (optional for image learning)
- Input gestures are classified into categories like:
  - Fist
  - Palm
  - Peace sign
  - OK sign, etc.

---

## 🧪 Workflow

### Data Preprocessing

- Loaded images from directories or CSV labels
- Resized and normalized image data
- Encoded gesture labels
- Split dataset into training and testing sets

### Model Training

- Trained classifier using SVM or CNN
- Performed tuning using cross-validation (if applicable)

### Evaluation

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Real-time gesture demo (optional)

---

## 📈 Results

- Achieved gesture recognition accuracy of **90%+** on test data
- Well-performing model for multi-class gesture classification
- Ready for integration with real-time video systems

---

## 🔍 Application

This model can be integrated into:

- Touchless UIs
- Robotics control
- Smart devices
- Gaming interfaces
- Accessibility tools (sign language interpretation)
